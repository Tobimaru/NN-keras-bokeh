# NN-keras-bokeh
Simple Neural Networks in Keras with visualisation in Bokeh <br><br>
This is a collection of python notebooks that implements neural networks with minimal architecture in Keras to illustrate the association with manifold transformations. It's essentially a Keras implementation with visualization in Bokeh of what is explained on Christopher Olah's blog (http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/) and demonstrated by Andrej Karpathy in ConvNetJS (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html)
